# Intro-to-Quantum-Computing
Learner Space 2025 Course conducted under Maths and Physics (MnP) Club, IIT Bombay


# Course Overview

Quantum computing is a field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits represented by transistors, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits), which can be realized even by single atoms under specific constraints. At the quantum scale, matter behaves both like particles and waves, enabling powerful new ways to perform computation. This course introduces the foundational concepts of quantum mechanics relevant to computing, explores the specialized hardware and algorithms used in quantum systems, and highlights how scalable quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts.
